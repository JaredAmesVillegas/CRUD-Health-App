# Basic CRUD Health App

A basic app I helped make during CSE-4550 Software Engineering class

## Purpose of the app

The purpose of this app was to mock read health metrics through a ionic front end with an Firebase Database and an angular backend. 

## Section I worked on

I specifically contributed on creating the graph aspect of this project, using a library called chart.js to construct a visual representation of your data in this app pulling from the Firebase DB.

## Why was this uploaded

I uploaded this to at least remind myself I actually worked on a group project and for any prospect employers to check my skills  

## Dependencies

Located in Package.json, includes Ionic Framework (https://ionicframework.com) as well as angular dependencies and firebase dependencies.
